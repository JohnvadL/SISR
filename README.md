# Single Image Super Resolution
This Repository contains two different approaches to Single Image Super Resolution.
## Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network
- [SRGAN_x64](SRGAN_x64.ipynb): Uses SRGAN architecture trained on ImageNet 64x64 set trained for a 150,000 iterations.
- [SRGAN_x96](SRGAN_x96.ipynb): Uses a modified Discriminator with train data scraped from Flickr randomly cropped to 96x96. Similarly trained for a 150,000 iterations.
